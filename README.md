# ConvLSTM for AnDi Challenge
This repositoy contains the PyTorch code for convolutional LSTM used in AnDi Challenge.


# The model
the model uses two convolutional layers followed by a 3 layer bidirectional LSTM

# What is included in this Repository
* The trained model which was submitted to the andi challenge "85_conv_LSTM_350K". This model can be used by using torch.load() in a jupyter notebook that contains the class ConejeroConvNet.
* Model Trainer This notebook contains all the code necessary to train our convolutional LSTM.
